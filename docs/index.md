## Project Overview

This project explores the secondhand luxury fashion market using ~900,000 listings from Vestiaire Collective. We analyze:

- Brand-level resale value  
- Condition and category effects  
- Seller reputation and popularity signals  
- Predictive modeling of resale price

Our goal was to understand and explore what drives price in the secondhand luxury market through interactive dashboards and predictive modeling. 

## Key Findings
- Luxury brands like Chanel, Gucci, and Louis Vuitton retain the highest resale value.  
- Condition strongly influences price, especially for handbags and shoes.  
- Our Random Forest model predicts resale price with solid accuracy and highlights brand/condition as the top predictors.
