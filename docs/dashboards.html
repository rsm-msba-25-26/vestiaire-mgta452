    <!-- ====================== 1. BRAND & MARKET OVERVIEW ====================== -->

    <h2>1. Brand & Market Overview</h2>

    <h3>Global Market Overview</h3>
    <p><strong>Key insights:</strong>  
      Italy, France, and the United States dominate the secondhand luxury market with the highest number of listings, while Eastern Europe and East Asia also contribute significantly. Supply is heavily concentrated in Western fashion hubs, reflecting strong resale ecosystems in these regions.  
      Additionally, Italy leads with 236K products, nearly double France and the US. Western Europe is the core market cluster, while Poland, Romania, and Greece are emerging contributors worth watching. Segmenting strategy by volume vs premium regions could be effective.

    <h3>Brand Overview</h3>
    <p><strong>Key insights:</strong>  
      Chanel, Cartier, Loro Piana, and Hermès attract the highest average like counts, signaling strong demand and desirability. However, Gucci and Prada lead in total listing volume. This contrast highlights the difference between “popular brands” and “high-value, high-engagement brands.”  
      Cartier and Rick Owens punch above their weight in engagement despite fewer listings. Chanel and Hermès perform well in both likes and volume. Spotlighting niche high-like brands alongside volume leaders can balance reach and desirability.

    <!-- ====================== 2. CONDITION, LIKES & CATEGORY ====================== -->

    <h2>2. Condition, Likes & Category Insights</h2>

    <h3>Like Count Insights</h3>
    <p><strong>Key insights:</strong>  
      Accessories—especially Women’s Accessories and Men’s Accessories—receive the highest average like counts, even at moderate price points. High engagement suggests these categories are especially trend-driven and visually appealing, making them more discoverable on resale platforms.  
      Women’s Accessories dominate in engagement (~10 likes), followed by Men’s Accessories (~6). Shoes and clothing trail behind. Prioritizing high-like categories for visibility and conversion is recommended.

      </iframe>
    </div>

    <h3>Condition Insights</h3>
    <p><strong>Key insights:</strong>  
      Even within the same condition level (e.g., “Good condition”), categories show wide variation in average resale value. Men’s Accessories and Women’s Accessories significantly outperform clothing categories in price, demonstrating that category matters as much as condition in determining value.  
      Women’s Accessories also lead in average price (~$9.70). Clothing and shoes are priced lower (~$3–5). Products in good condition perform well overall—emphasizing this in filters and search UX can boost buyer confidence.

    <!-- ====================== 3. COUNTRY LEVEL INSIGHTS ====================== -->

    <h2>3. Country-Level Insights</h2>

    <h3>Country by Average Likes</h3>
    <p><strong>Key insights:</strong>  
      Countries in South America and parts of Eastern Europe show unusually high average like counts despite lower listing volume. This implies strong buyer interest relative to supply—indicating potentially underserved resale markets.  
      These regions represent growth opportunities: high demand but lower supply, making them ideal for targeted expansion or marketing campaigns.

      </iframe>
    </div>

    <h3>Country by Average Price</h3>
    <p><strong>Key insights:</strong>  
      Russia and several Eastern European countries show some of the highest average resale prices globally, while Western Europe and North America cluster in the mid-range. This suggests price sensitivity varies widely across regions, and high-price markets do not always correlate with high listing volume.  
      Africa and South America lean toward lower average prices—ideal for volume-driven strategies. Russia and nearby regions may be better suited for premium positioning.

<h2>4. Summary of Market Insights</h2>
<p>The dashboards collectively reveal several consistent pricing patterns across the secondhand luxury market:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Supply Concentration:</strong> Most listings originate from Italy, France, the U.S., and the U.K., reflecting established resale ecosystems in major fashion hubs.</li>
  <li><strong>Brand Power:</strong> High-end heritage brands such as Chanel, Hermès, and Loro Piana command strong engagement and higher resale value, while brands like Gucci and Prada dominate in listing volume.</li>
  <li><strong>Condition Matters:</strong> Items in “Very Good” or “New/Never Worn” condition significantly outperform worn pieces in average resale price.</li>
  <li><strong>Category Effects:</strong> Accessories (both men’s and women’s) show disproportionately high like counts and strong price performance relative to clothing categories.</li>
  <li><strong>Geographic Variation:</strong> Several Eastern European and Asian markets display high average prices, while South America shows high engagement despite lower supply.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Practical Implications</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>For Sellers:</strong> Focus on listing high-engagement categories (e.g., accessories) and highlight condition clearly to maximize resale value.</li>
  <li><strong>For Buyers:</strong> High-like regions and categories may signal competitive markets where desirable items sell quickly.</li>
  <li><strong>For Platforms:</strong> Opportunity exists to improve visibility and supply in emerging markets with high engagement but low inventory (e.g., South America).</li>
  <li><strong>For Luxury Brands:</strong> Consistently high resale value among heritage brands reinforces long-term brand equity and demand stability.</li>
</ul>
